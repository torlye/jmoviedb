moviedb is a small application written by by Joel Klinghed. It is an invaluable tool for organizing and keeping track of a large movie collection, and lets you keep track of stuff like:
 * Which movies you have seen and which you haven't
 * The file format of each movie
 * Audio and subtitle languages for each movie
 * Buddies who have borrowed one or more of your movies
 * Lots of movie details downloaded from imdb.com
 * DVD-cover or movie poster downloaded from imdb.com

Unfortunately, development of moviedb ceased in 2003, the last relase was 2.0 RC4. It continued working fine for a while, but In early 2007 IMDb changed their website, and moviedb could no longer download information from their website.
