#summary A list of features and their implementation progress
#labels Featured

== Completed or nearly completed ==
  * The main application window - menus, toolbars, status line etc.
  * Saving to and loading from the `*`.jmdb file format
  * Embedded Derby SQL Database for storage
  * A simple movie list in the main window showing the contents of the database
  * Sorting the main window movie list on ID, title, year, rating or format. Ascending or descending sort direction.
  * A tabbed movie dialog box for viewing/editing detailed information about a movie.
  * Movie dialog: "Main" tab - movie title and cover image, most details about the movie itself is located here.
  * Movie dialog: "Tagline/plot" tab.
  * Movie dialog: "Actors" tab - a list of the cast.
  * Import data from IMDb - still needs some nice GUI dialogs and probably a progeress bar.
  * Open a website in the system's browser when clicking a link in JMoviedb. Would be used to easily open a movie's IMDb page, etc. Will only work on [http://browserlaunch2.sourceforge.net/platformsupport.shtml certain platforms]. Intelligent handling of cases where it does not work is planned.
  * "Live" search feature, search as you type. - Done, except for selecting search parameters (currently it only searches through movie titles)

== Under heavy development right now ==
  * Ant buildfile for build automation. Downloads build dependencies automatically and merges their contents into the application jar file, but filters so that only the referenced classes are used. Should ideally be able to build jar files for all supported platforms in one go, and create deb/rpm/pkg packages and the NSIS install script.
  * Windows installer/uninstaller based on NSIS

== Not implemented yet ==
  * An advanced movie list showing cover image, format, rating, runtime etc. for each movie type. Will include colour coding on seen/not seen status and format type. See [moviedb the moviedb page] for details.
  * Movie dialog: "Format/video" tab - details about the format type (DVD, VHS, Blu-Ray etc) and the video format of the movie.
  * Movie dialog: "Audio/subtitles" tab - details about the audio/subtitle languages and formats.
  * Special handling of TV-series. Example: A TV-series entry in the database may represent a DVD box set containing season 1 of the series
  * IMDb mass import - update all movies in the list with data from imdb.com. It may be advantageous to make this feature multi-threaded, so that it will download data for two or more movies at the same time. This should lead to better bandwidth utilization and faster downloads depending on the connection.
  * Filtering the main window movie list different criteria, for example "show only movies that I have not seen".
  * Importing data from the CSV-format that moviedb uses - needs an improved GUI dialog.
  * Importing data from plain text files.
  * Exporting data to other formats (plain text, CSV, HTML?).
  * Loans - keep track of which movies you have lent to your buddies.
  * Printing support.
  * .deb and .rpm packages for Linux. Debian/Ubuntu .deb packages have higher priority.
  * .pkg packages for OSX
