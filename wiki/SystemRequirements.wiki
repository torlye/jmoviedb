#summary System requirements

== System requirements ==

=== Summarized ===
  * The Sun Java Runtime Environment, version 1.5 (5.0) or newer
  * Any combination of system architecture and operating system that supports [http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ Eclipse SWT]. See website for details.
  * An internet connection is required for 

=== Details ===
In reality, JMoviedb will only be tested on a few operating systems, namely:
  * Windows x86
  * Windows x86-64
  * Linux x86
  * Linux x86-64
  * Linux PowerPC
  * Mac OS X
Windows testing will mainly be done on Windows XP. The latest release of Ubuntu will be used for Linux testing, while an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSx86 OSx86] release of Leopart will have to suffice for Mac testing.

JMoviedb uses the [http://browserlaunch2.sourceforge.net BrowserLauncher2] library, which adds the capability to open websites in the system's default browser. BrowserLauncher2 uses system specific system calls, and has limited platform and browser support. It should work with the most common counfigurations, though. ([http://browserlaunch2.sourceforge.net/platformsupport.shtml Details]) JMoviedb works fine even without BrowserLauncher2 support, but the user will have to open any websites maually by copying/pasting URLs.

==== Notes for 64-bit Windows: ====
JMoviedb will run in 64-bit mode on x86-64 systems, also known as AMD64, EM64T or x64. A 64-bit version of Windows (such as Windows XP Professional x64 Edition) and a 64-bit Java environment are needed.

Sun has a 64-bit version of Java 6 available, but it is not prominently displayed on their website and may be hard to find.

The 32-bit version of JMoviedb will work on 64-bit systems using a 32-bit Java version.
