INCOMPLETE FEATURES
-------------------
Complete MovieDialog - More specifically: Add TV-series support, rearrange controls between the tabs, fix many idiosyncrasies 
Improve various GUIs, prevent dialogs from resizing depending on contents
Improve model layer, it is currently poorly designed. Could possibly read data directly from database instead of storing it temporarily in the model layer classes 
Some of the enum types are incomplete
GuiLanguage classes are a joke. Remove or redesign.
Tweak MovieTableCell behaviour when resizing
