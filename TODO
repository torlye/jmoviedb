INCOMPLETE FEATURES
-------------------
Complete MovieDialog - More specifically: Add TV-series support, complete the final two tabs, fix many idiosyncracies
In the MovieDialog, move 'writers' and 'directors' to the 'actors' tab - and rename the tab to something that fits. Possibly "Cast and Crew" or "People" 
Improve various GUIs, prevent dialog boxes from resizing depending on contents
Improve model layer, it is currently poorly designed. Could possibly read data directly from database instead of storing it temporarily in the model layer classes 
Some of the enum types are incomplete
GuiLanguage classes are a joke. Remove or redesign.
Tweak MovieTableCell behaviour when resizing
